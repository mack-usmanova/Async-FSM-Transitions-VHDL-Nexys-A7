# Async-FSM-Transitions-VHDL-Nexys-A7
Asynchronous sequential “transitions” circuit implemented in VHDL using three feedback state bits (Y1–Y3) and two inputs (X1/X2), with Vivado constraints enabling combinational loops and a Tcl force script verifying behavior in post-route simulation and on a Nexys A7.
